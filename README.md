# Settlers of Catan Board Generator

## TODO
[ ] - Maintain previous board (would be nice to have up to 10) - prevent accidental button press
[ ] - Allow hex/tile number move - useState to maintain current hex selected and have red thick pulsing circle on option (stroke color?)
[ ] - Allow pure random (no extra rules such as unique 6/8s) - maybe configurable options menu options that can be brought up with a menu and another button to enable/disable. Once options menu button is pressed again, board is reloaded with the updated rules
